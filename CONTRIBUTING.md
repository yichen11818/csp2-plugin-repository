## üöÄ Submission Process

### 1. Prerequisites

Before submitting, ensure your plugin:

- ‚úÖ Is hosted on GitHub
- ‚úÖ Has at least one Release with a downloadable .zip file
- ‚úÖ Is compatible with CounterStrikeSharp or Metamod
- ‚úÖ Has a README with installation and usage instructions
- ‚úÖ Uses semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0, v2.1.3)
- ‚úÖ Is open source (public repository)

### 2. Fork the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/csp2-plugin-repository.git
cd csp2-plugin-repository
git checkout -b add-my-plugin
```

### 3. Create Plugin Configuration

Create a new file in the `plugins/` directory named `your-plugin-id.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "../schemas/plugin.schema.json",
  "id": "your-plugin-id",
  "enabled": true,
  "autoUpdate": true,
  "repository": {
    "type": "github",
    "owner": "your-github-username",
    "repo": "your-plugin-repo",
    "releaseType": "latest"
  },
  "downloadPattern": "YourPluginName.zip",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "Your Plugin Display Name",
    "descriptionZh": "Êèí‰ª∂ÁöÑ‰∏≠ÊñáÊèèËø∞ÔºàÂèØÈÄâ‰ΩÜÊé®ËçêÔºâ",
    "category": "gameplay",
    "tags": ["relevant", "tags", "here"],
    "framework": "counterstrikesharp",
    "featured": false
  },
  "installation": {
    "type": "extract",
    "targetPath": "game/csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins",
    "files": ["YourPluginName/*"]
  },
  "verification": {

    "verifiedAt": "2025-10-27T00:00:00Z",
    "notes": "Brief description of what you've tested"
  }
}
```

### 4. Validate Your Configuration

```bash
npm install
npm run validate
```

Fix any errors before proceeding.

### 5. Test Manifest Generation

```bash
# Optional: Set GitHub token to avoid rate limits
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here

npm run generate
```

This ensures your plugin can be fetched from GitHub successfully.

### 6. Submit Pull Request

```bash
git add plugins/your-plugin-id.json
git commit -m "feat: add YourPluginName to repository"
git push origin add-my-plugin
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
